# Neurable Cube Example

Originally we were going to let people rotate a cube with their mind, but then
we decided to use a Mickey Mouse OBJ model. The model rotates around its center
in response to keyboard commands which our system generates in response to p300
brain signals. This repo only contains the display portion of our larger
project.

IMPORTANT: Click inside the display block and press an arrow key to render mouse!!!
